                        <p class="text-left" style="max-width:100%;background-color:#f6f6f6;"><br>OSHA (ALL OFFICES):<br><br>There are more than 8 OSHA regulations and guidelines that physician offices must be in compliance with. OSHA can inspect your facility at any time. OSHA can fine you for any violations. Many physicians
                            are only in compliance with the Bloodborne Pathogen Standard and have not addressed other OSHA standards. Ninety percent of the offices inspected are cited and fined for violation related to Hazardous Communication, Occupational
                            Exposure, Tuberculosis or Ergonomic standards! Safety is more important now than ever before. All physicians are responsible to provide a safe work environment and educate their employees on safety policies. All safety training
                            programs are accredited and are customized to the facility and tasks performed The following OSHA services are available:&nbsp;<br><br>OSHA SAFETY TRAINING PROGRAM:<br><br>Our OSHA program provides the most up to date safety
                            information available. The program is customized to the tasks performed at your office. You can choose a power point presentation, classroom (oral) presentation or our new “safety game”. NO BORING GENERIC DVD’s or VIDEOS ARE
                            USED! Each presentation comes with a handout and participants receive a certificate of training upon completing the program. Training booklets can be ordered separately to train new hires between annual programs. OSHA SAFETY
                            MANUAL:<br><br>Over 5,000 copies sold! It is written for a physician office - not a hospital. Easy to use and personalize. Manual is updated annually to include the most up to date regulatory information. If your manual is
                            over 5 years old and has not been upgraded regularly - it is obsolete! We provide upgrades - free - for 6 months after purchase then annual upgrades are offered for a nominal charge.<br><br>OSHA CONSULTATION:<br><br>Our initial
                            consultation is as thorough as it gets! Your office will have a 12 page report with corrective action plan before we leave your office. We also offer follow-up consultations to check on-going compliance. Discount for multiple
                            office practices.<br><br>OSHA COMPLIANCE PACKAGE:&nbsp;<br><br>If you are a first time customer - this is a money saving way to go. Includes initial consultation, OSHA manual, safety training, MSDS’s and personalized policies.<br><br>HIPAA
                            (ALL OFFICES):<br><br>HIPAA consultation, training and manual was added to our services in 2001. Our clients can not get over how simple POC can make compliance. Why sit through endless seminars given by law firms trying to
                            scare you into paying ridiculous fees to assist you. In a few hours we’ll have you ready to go! Our consultant uses a 10 page checklist. You will have a copy with recommendation before we leave the office. Our HIPAA manual
                            is continually updated as new HIPAA regulations are released. Our HIPAA training program is for the entire staff. If you have a concern - we will address it at this meeting. All services are available separately or as a package.<br><br>CLIA
                            (LABORATORY REGULATIONS):<br><br>We offer consultations for both waived/PPM andnon-waived (moderate/high) complexity labs. Our customized laboratory procedure manuals, sold nationally, can be ordered separately. Start-up evaluations
                            for new labs, maintenance programs for existing labs, corrective action consults for post inspection and pre-inspection quality assurance checks are available. We can select a proficiency testing program that is the most cost
                            effective for the tests you perform. Our clients pass inspections with high scores. CLIA service fees are based on lab size, tests performed and reason for services.<br><br></p>
