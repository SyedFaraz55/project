                            <p><br><br> <strong>1. GET A CLIA REGISTRATION NUMBER</strong><br><br><br> In N.J. - go on the NJ web site: www.NJ.US.Health and print out&nbsp;instructions and forms for CLIA licencing or call the N.J. Department of Health and
                                Licencing at (609) 292-0016. Ask for a CLIA #116 form to be sent<br> to your office. Fill out and send the #116 form to N.J. Department of&nbsp;Health - CLIA, CN 361, Trenton, N.J. 08625-0361. Do not sent money - you&nbsp;will
                                be billed for registration and first inspection.<br><br><br> If you are in N.J. go on the NJ web site (www.state.nj/health/phel/clis)&nbsp;and print instructions and forms (application, personnel, ownership&nbsp;disclosure)
                                for a N.J. State CLIS liciense. Fill out, copy and return to<br> N.J. Department of Health - Dept. of Laboratory Licencing, CN 360, Trenton,&nbsp;N.J. 08625-0360. Do not sent money - you will be billed for licence.<br><br><br>                                <strong>2. JOIN A PROFICIENCY TESTING COMPANY</strong><br><br><br> There are numerous companies to choose from. List is found in your&nbsp;laboratory manual or a list is attached. Prices vary so it is wise to do a&nbsp;cost
                                comparisons. Join for all moderate complexity tests that are<br> available.&nbsp;If you are in N.J. and office have a CLIS laboratory license make sure the<br> PT program is a NJ state approved program.<br><br><br> <br><strong>        3. CHOOSE BETWEEN PRIVATE INSPECTION OR FEDERAL INSPECTION (Inspection</strong><br><strong>        performed by the State of N.J. for CMA or private inspection by COLA)</strong><br><strong>    </strong><br><br><br>                                The cost of inspection takes into account how many specialties and how many&nbsp;tests you perform. If you are low volume, a government inspection is &nbsp;usually less.<br><br><br> The cost of private inspection is based
                                on how many doctors are in the&nbsp;practice and how may specialties are performed. To obtain information on&nbsp;private inspection call COLA at (800) 298-8044.<br><br><br> <strong>4. MAKE SURE LABORATORY PERSONNEL FILES ARE COMPLETE</strong><br><br><br>                                Each person performing tests or filling a CLIA position should have a&nbsp;detailed job description, record of training, diploma (high school at&nbsp;minimum), licenses, training, 6 month and 1 year evaluation (then annual),&nbsp;continuing
                                education, hepatitis record, safety training record.<br><br><br> <strong>6. LABORATORY PROCEDURE MANUAL</strong><br><br><br> Procedure manual(s) must have instructions for ALL tests performed.&nbsp;Procedures must be written
                                to comply with CLIA guidelines. Operator manuals&nbsp;and package inserts may be used but may need supplementary information to&nbsp;meet CLIA guidelines. It is best to refer to the Federal Register (Feb. 28,<br> 1992)
                                for what needs to be included. All procedures must be signed and&nbsp;dated by the director. The manual must also include information of specimen&nbsp;collection and storage.<br><br><br> <strong>7. QUALITY CONTROL</strong><br><br><br>                                Quality control must be performed and documented according to manufacturer&nbsp;recommendations or CLIA regulations for all tests. Documentation may be&nbsp;done by computer (linked to instrument) or manually. COLA will
                                want to see&nbsp;quality control on Levy-Jenning charts for all instrument performed tests.<br> The director or technical consultant must sign off on quality control each&nbsp;month.<br><br><br> <strong>8. INSTRUMENT MAINTENANCE </strong><br><br><br>                                Instrument maintenance includes all routine and additional maintenance&nbsp;needed. Validation studies must be documented on all new equipment. ALL routine and manufacturer maintenance must be documented. Calibration must&nbsp;be
                                performed as recommended by the manufacturer or at minimum, every 6&nbsp;months (which ever comes first). Maintenance also includes temperature&nbsp;checks, timer checks, centrifuge checks and pipette calibration.<br><br><br>                                <strong>9. PATIENT TEST MANAGEMENT TRACKING RECORDS</strong><br><br><br> Documentation that includes adequate information on test requisitions&nbsp;forms, test record (accession logs), turn around time, specimen labeling,&nbsp;proper
                                test preparation and test reports must be according to CLIA quality&nbsp;assessment guidelines.<br><br><br> <strong>10. QUALITY ASSESSMENT</strong><br><br><br> The office must have a documented system in place that shows
                                how the&nbsp;laboratory policies they have put in place work. Professionally prepared&nbsp;quality assessment plans are available but must be personalized to reflect&nbsp;your personal practice. Document all QA activities!<br>
